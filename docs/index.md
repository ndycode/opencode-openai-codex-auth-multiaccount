## How It Works

The plugin intercepts OpenCode's OpenAI SDK requests and transforms them for the ChatGPT backend API:

```
OpenCode SDK Request
        ↓
    OAuth Token Management (auto-refresh)
        ↓
    Request Transformation (SDK → Codex API)
        ↓
    AI SDK Compatibility (filter constructs)
        ↓
    Stateless Operation (store: false)
        ↓
ChatGPT Codex Backend
```

See [Architecture](development/ARCHITECTURE.md) for technical details.
