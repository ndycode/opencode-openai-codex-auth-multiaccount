			"body": "## New Features\n- Added `WS_PROXY`/`WSS_PROXY` environment support (including lowercase variants) for websocket proxying in the network proxy. (#11784)\n- App-server v2 now emits notifications when threads are archived or unarchived, enabling clients to react without polling. (#12030)\n- Protocol/core now carry distinct approval IDs for command approvals to support multiple approvals within a single shell command execution flow. (#12051)\n\n## Bug Fixes\n- `Ctrl+C`/`Ctrl+D` now cleanly exits the cwd-change prompt during resume/fork flows instead of implicitly selecting an option. (#12040)\n- Reduced false-positive safety-check downgrade behavior by relying on the response header model (and websocket top-level events) rather than the response body model slug. (#12061)\n\n## Documentation\n- Updated docs and schemas to cover websocket proxy configuration, new thread archive/unarchive notifications, and the command approval ID plumbing. (#11784, #12030, #12051)\n\n## Chores\n- Made the Rust release workflow resilient to `npm publish` attempts for an already-published version. (#12044)\n- Standardized remote compaction test mocking and refreshed related snapshots to align with the default production-shaped behavior. (#12050)\n\n## Changelog\n\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/openai/codex/compare/rust-v0.103.0...rust-v0.104.0\n\n- #11784 feat(network-proxy): add websocket proxy env support @viyatb-oai\n- #12044 don't fail if an npm publish attempt is for an existing version. @iceweasel-oai\n- #12040 tui: exit session on Ctrl+C in cwd change prompt @charley-oai\n- #12030 app-server: Emit thread archive/unarchive notifications @euroelessar\n- #12061 Chore: remove response model check and rely on header model for downgrade @shijie-oai\n- #12051 feat(core): plumb distinct approval ids for command approvals @owenlin0\n- #12050 Unify remote compaction snapshot mocks around default endpoint behavior @charley-oai\n\n\n",
