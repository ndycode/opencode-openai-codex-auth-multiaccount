			"body": "## New Features\n- Added `WS_PROXY`/`WSS_PROXY` environment support (including lowercase variants) for websocket proxying in the network proxy. (#11784)\n- App-server v2 now emits notifications when threads are archived or unarchived, enabling clients to react without polling. (#12030)\n- Protocol/core now carry distinct approval IDs for command approvals to support multiple approvals within a single shell command execution flow. (#12051)\n\n## Bug Fixes\n- `Ctrl+C`/`Ctrl+D` now cleanly exits the cwd-change prompt during resume/fork flows instead of implicitly selecting an option. (#12040)\n- Reduced false-positive safety-check downgrade behavior by relying on the response header model (and websocket top-level events) rather than the response body model slug. (#12061)\n\n## Documentation\n- Updated docs and schemas to cover websocket proxy configuration, new thread archive/unarchive notifications, and the command approval ID plumbing. (#11784, #12030, #12051)\n\n## Chores\n- Made the Rust release workflow resilient to `npm publish` attempts for an already-published version. (#12044)\n- Standardized remote compaction test mocking and refreshed related snapshots to align with the default production-shaped behavior. (#12050)\n\n## Changelog\n\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/openai/codex/compare/rust-v0.103.0...rust-v0.104.0\n\n- #11784 feat(network-proxy): add websocket proxy env support @viyatb-oai\n- #12044 don't fail if an npm publish attempt is for an existing version. @iceweasel-oai\n- #12040 tui: exit session on Ctrl+C in cwd change prompt @charley-oai\n- #12030 app-server: Emit thread archive/unarchive notifications @euroelessar\n- #12061 Chore: remove response model check and rely on header model for downgrade @shijie-oai\n- #12051 feat(core): plumb distinct approval ids for command approvals @owenlin0\n- #12050 Unify remote compaction snapshot mocks around default endpoint behavior @charley-oai\n\n\n",

GPT-5.1-Codex-Max delivers higher reliability, faster iteration, and support for long-running, project-scale workflows. Learn more at https://www.openai.com/index/gpt-5-1-codex-max\r\n- Native Compaction Support: added first-class support for Compaction, improving performance across extended coding sessions.\r\n- Expanded Tool Token Limits: codex models now support up to 10,000 tool output tokens. Configure this via `tool_output_token_limit` in `config.toml`.\r\n- Windows Agent mode: Introduced Agent mode for native Windows. Codex can read files, write files, and run commands in your working folder with fewer approvals. Agent mode uses a new experimental Windows sandbox to limit filesystem and network access.

			"body": "## Features\r\n\r\n  - Threads and turns now include git info, current working directory, CLI version, source metadata, and propagate thread and turn IDs on every item and error. They emit new notifications for diffs, plan updates, token-usage changes, and compaction events. File-change items provide output deltas, and ImageView items render images inline.\r\n  - Review flow is enhanced with a detached review mode, explicit enter and exit events, review thread IDs, and review history remains visible after rollout filtering changes.\r\n  - Execution gains an experimental “exp” model, unified exec pruning to limit session bloat, per-run custom environment injection, policy-approved command bypass, and Windows protections that flag risky browser or URL launches. History lookup now works on Windows and WSL, and model selection honors use_model.\r\n  - Safety defaults improve via consolidated world-writable scanning and workspace-write enforcement of read-only .git directories. Sandbox assessment and approval flows align with trust policies.\r\n  - MCP and shell tooling add shell-tool MCP login support, explicit capability declaration, sandbox awareness, publication to npm, and MCP elicitations. The rmcp client is upgraded to 0.10.0 for modern notifications.\r\n  - Observability increases as command items expose process IDs and threads and turns emit token-usage and compaction events. Feedback metadata captures source information.\r\n  - Tooling and ops gain follow-up v2 in the app-server test client, new config management utilities, and refreshed approvals documentation and quickstart placement.\r\n\r\n ## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n  - PowerShell apply_patch parsing is corrected, and apply_patch tests now cover shell_command behavior.\r\n  - Sandbox assessment regression is fixed, policy-approved commands are honored, dangerous-command checks are tightened on Windows, and workspace-write enforces .git read-only.\r\n  - MCP startup tolerates missing type fields, stream error messages are clarified, and rmcp nix output hash issues are resolved.\r\n  - Delegate cancellation no longer hangs unified exec, early-exit sessions are cleaned up, and duplicate “waited” renderings are suppressed.\r\n  - recent_commits with limit zero now returns zero, and the NetBSD process-hardening build is unblocked.\r\n  - Review rollout filtering is disabled so history shows, approval presets respect workspace-write, /approvals trust detection is corrected, and sandbox command assessment edge cases are fixed.\r\n  - Compaction accounts for encrypted reasoning, handles token budgets accurately, and emits reliable token-usage and compaction events.\r\n  - TTY stdin is required, WSL clipboard paths are normalized, and stale conversations are dropped on /new to avoid conflicts.\r\n  - Custom prompt expansion with large pastes is fixed, example-config mistakes are corrected, and relative links and streamable_shell references are cleaned up. Upgrade messaging is corrected.\r\n  - Windows sandbox treats <workspace_root>/.git as read-only, and risky browser launches are flagged before execution.\r\n  - CLA allowlist now includes dependabot variants, and enterprises can skip upgrade checks and messages.\r\n  - Flaky tests are stabilized, session recycling is improved, and rollout session initialization surfaces errors for diagnosis.\r\n\r\n ## Maintenance\r\n\r\n  - Security and CI add cargo-audit and cargo-deny. GitHub Actions are updated to checkout v6 and upload-artifact v5. macOS 13 builds are dropped. A flaky Ubuntu variant is skipped. The next_minor_version script now resets the patch number correctly.\r\n  - Dependencies are updated: libc 0.2.177, webbrowser 1.0.6, regex 1.12.2, toml_edit 0.23.5, arboard 3.6.1, serde_with 3.16.1, image 0.25.9, reqwest 0.12.24, tracing 0.1.43, and rmcp 0.10.0.\r\n  - Documentation is refreshed: approvals and config guidance, codex max and xhigh defaults, example-config fixes, CLA guidance, and removal of streamable_shell references.\r\n\r\n## PRs Merged\r\n\r\n  -

Thanks to @cnaples79 who contributed the [core part](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/4017) of this fix!\r\n  - Cloud exec: codex cloud exec accepts --branch for remote runs and now exposes status/diff/apply flows so you can inspect and apply changes from the cloud path (#7602, #7614).\r\n  - Signing: Linux artifacts are signed via sigstore. (#7674).\r\n  - General fixes: parallel tool-call chat now returns correctly, ghost snapshot tokens aren’t billed, missing tool names no longer crash the litellm proxy, and migration prompts use HTTPS links\r\n    (#7634, #7638, #7724, #7705).\r\n\r\n\r\n### PRs Merged\r\n\r\n  - #6793 FIX: WSL Paste image does not work @Waxime64\r\n  - #6846 feat(core) Add login to shell_command tool @dylan-hurd-oai\r\n  - #6918 Add Enterprise plan to ChatGPT login description @ae-openai\r\n  - #7033 whitelist command prefix integration in core and tui @zhao-oai\r\n  - #7310 Inline response recording and remove process_items indirection @aibrahim-oai\r\n  - #7515 fix(apply-patch): preserve CRLF line endings on Windows @dylan-hurd-oai\r\n  - #7543 execpolicy tui flow @zhao-oai\r\n  - #7544 Refactor execpolicy fallback evaluation @zhao-oai\r\n  - #7547 Use shared check sandboxing @pakrym-oai\r\n  - #7554 chore(core): test apply_patch_cli on Windows @dylan-hurd-oai\r\n  - #7561 Do not emit start/end events for write stdin @pakrym-oai\r\n  - #7563 Slightly better status display for unified exec @pakrym-oai\r\n  - #7567 chore(apply-patch) scenarios for e2e testing @dylan-hurd-oai\r\n  - #7571 remove model_family from `config @aibrahim-oai\r\n  - #7580 feat: update sandbox policy to allow TTY @jif-oai\r\n  - #7583 Fix handle_shortcut_overlay_key for cross-platform consistency @448523760\r\n  - #7588 chore: default warning messages to true @jif-oai\r\n  - #7591 chore: tool tip for /prompt @jif-oai\r\n  - #7592 fix: release session ID when not used @jif-oai\r\n  - #7593 chore: review in read-only @jif-oai\r\n  - #7594 fix: sse for chat @jif-oai\r\n  - #7595 Update execpolicy.md @zhao-oai\r\n  - #7602 add --branch to codex cloud exec @nornagon-openai\r\n  - #7603 Add models endpoint @aibrahim-oai\r\n  - #7605 fix(app-server): add duration_ms to McpToolCallItem @owenlin0\r\n  - #7609 feat: exec policy integration in shell mcp @zhao-oai\r\n  - #7610 fix: taking plan type from usage endpoint instead of thru auth token @zhao-oai\r\n  - #7611 fix(app-server): add will_retry to ErrorNotification @owenlin0\r\n  - #7614 cloud: status, diff, apply @nornagon-openai\r\n  - #7615 chore: refactor to move Arc<RwLock> concern outside exec_policy_for @bolinfest\r\n  - #7616 Call models endpoint in models manager @aibrahim-oai\r\n  - #7617 fix: add integration tests for codex-exec-mcp-server with execpolicy @bolinfest\r\n  - #7620 Fix unified_exec on windows @pakrym\r\n  - #7621 Wire with_remote_overrides to construct model families @aibrahim-oai\r\n  - #7626 fix typo @zhao-oai\r\n  - #7629 fix(tui): add missing Ctrl+n/Ctrl+p support to ListSelectionView @pppp606\r\n  - #7634 fix: chat completion with parallel tool call @jif-oai\r\n  - #7638 fix: ignore ghost snapshots in token consumption @jif-oai\r\n  - #7645 Also load skills from repo root. @xl-openai\r\n  - #7648 Add remote models feature flag @aibrahim-oai\r\n  - #7651 fix: OTEL HTTP exporter panic and mTLS support @asm89\r\n  - #7652 Move justfile to repository root @joshka-oai\r\n  - #7653 proposing execpolicy amendment when prompting due to sandbox denial @zhao-oai\r\n  - #7654 fix: exec-server stream was erroring for large requests @bolinfest\r\n  - #7655 fix wrap behavior for long commands @zhao-oai\r\n  - #7660 Restore status header after stream recovery @joshka-oai\r\n  - #7665 docs: fix documentation of rmcp client flag @JaySabva\r\n  - #7669 fix(doc): TOML otel exporter example — multi-line inline table is invalid @448523760\r\n  - #7672 docs: Remove experimental_use_rmcp_client from config @JaySabva\r\n  - #7673 docs: point dev checks to just @voctory\r\n  - #7674 feat: linux codesign with sigstore @shijie-oai\r\n  - #7675 feat: windows codesign with Azure trusted signing @shijie-oai\r\n  - #7678 fix: clear out space on ubuntu runners before running Rust tests @bolinfest\r\n  - #7680 fix: ensure macOS CI runners for Rust tests include recent Homebrew fixes @bolinfest\r\n  - #7685 fix: refine the warning message and docs for deprecated tools config @gameofby\r\n  - #7705 fix: update URLs to use HTTPS in model migration prompts @rakleed\r\n  - #7709 Enhance model picker @aibrahim-oai\r\n  - #7711 Add formatting client version to the x.x.x style. @aibrahim-oai\r\n  - #7713 chore(deps): bump ts-rs from 11.0.1 to 11.1.0 in /codex-rs @dependabot[bot]\r\n  - #7714 chore(deps): bump derive_more from 2.0.1 to 2.1.0 in /codex-rs @dependabot[bot]\r\n  - #7715 chore(deps): bump insta from 1.43.2 to 1.44.3 in /codex-rs @dependabot[bot]\r\n  - #7716 chore(deps): bump wildmatch from 2.5.0 to 2.6.1 in /codex-rs @dependabot[bot]\r\n  - #7722 load models from disk and set a ttl and etag @aibrahim-oai\r\n  - #7724 Fixed regression for chat endpoint;

			"body": "## New Features\r\n- Add `Ctrl+G` to open the current prompt in your configured external editor (`$VISUAL`/`$EDITOR`) and sync edits back into the TUI. (#7606)\r\n- Support project-aware config layering: load repo-local `.codex/config.toml`, honor configurable `project_root_markers`, and merge that with system config like `/etc/codex/config.toml`. (#8354, #8359, #8461)\r\n- Support enterprise-managed configuration requirements on macOS via an MDM-provided TOML payload. (#8743)\r\n- Improve `tui2` transcript navigation with multi-click selection, a copy shortcut/affordance, and a draggable auto-hiding scrollbar. (#8462, #8471, #8728)\r\n- Start Windows PowerShell sessions in UTF-8 mode to reduce encoding-related prompt/output issues. (#7902)\r\n- Exec policy rules can now include human-readable justifications, and policy loading follows the unified config-layer stack. (#8349, #8453, #8751)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fix failures when the model returns multiple tool calls in a single turn by emitting tool calls in the format the Chat Completions API expects. (#8556)\r\n- Make `/review` compute diffs from the session’s working directory so base-branch detection works correctly with runtime cwd overrides. (#8738)\r\n- Handle the legacy Chat Completions streaming terminator cleanly to avoid spurious SSE parse errors. (#8708)\r\n- Fix a set of `tui2` rendering/input edge cases (screen corruption, scroll stickiness, and selection/copy correctness). (#8463, #8695, #8449)\r\n- Improve diagnostics when `ripgrep` download fails during CLI packaging so failures are easier to debug. (#8486)\r\n- Avoid a panic when parsing alpha/stable version strings. (#8406)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n- Replace and de-duplicate user docs with links to the developer documentation site (including skills docs). (#8662, #8407)\r\n- Clarify configuration documentation, including the `developer_instructions` option. (#8376, #8701)\r\n- Fix broken README links. (#8682)\r\n\r\n## Chores\r\n- Performance tuning for TUIs: cap redraw scheduling and reduce unnecessary rerenders during streaming to lower CPU usage. (#8499, #8681, #8693)\r\n- Update Rust dependencies across `codex-rs`. (#8414, #8596, #8597)\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/openai/codex/compare/rust-v0.77.0...rust-v0.78.0\r\n\r\n- #8407 Point skills docs to developer documentation site

			"body": "## New Features\r\n- Add conversation/thread fork endpoints in the protocol and app server so clients can branch a session into a new thread. (#8866)\r\n- Expose requirements via `requirement/list` so clients can read `requirements.toml` and adjust agent-mode UX. (#8800)\r\n- Introduce metrics capabilities with additional counters for observability. (#8318, #8910)\r\n- Add elevated sandbox onboarding with prompts for upgrade/degraded mode plus the `/elevate-sandbox` command. (#8789)\r\n- Allow explicit skill invocations through v2 API user input. (#8864)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Codex CLI subprocesses again inherit env vars like `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`/`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` to avoid runtime issues. As explained in #8945, failure to pass along these environment variables to subprocesses that expect them (notably GPU-related ones), was causing 10x+ performance regressions! Special thanks to @johnzfitch for the detailed investigation and write-up in #8945. (#8951)\r\n- `/review <instructions>` in TUI/TUI2 now launches the review flow instead of sending plain text. (#8823)\r\n- Patch approval “allow this session” now sticks for previously approved files. (#8451)\r\n- Model upgrade prompt now appears even if the current model is hidden from the picker. (#8802)\r\n- Windows paste handling now supports non-ASCII multiline input reliably. Special thanks to @occurrent laying the groundwork for this fix in #8021! (#8774)\r\n- Git apply path parsing now handles quoted/escaped paths and `/dev/null` correctly to avoid misclassified changes. (#8824)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n- App-server README now documents skills support and usage. (#8853)\r\n- Skill-creator docs clarify YAML frontmatter formatting and quoting rules.

(#9188)\r\n- The `codex` tool in `codex mcp-server` now includes the `threadId` in the response so it can be used with the `codex-reply` tool, fixing #3712. The documentation has been updated at https://developers.openai.com/codex/guides/agents-sdk/. (#9192)\r\n- Headless runs now switch to device-code login automatically so sign-in works without a browser. (#8756)\r\n- Linux sandbox can mount paths read-only to better protect files from writes.

(#8555)\r\n- Windows correctly prompts before unsafe commands when running with a read-only sandbox policy. (#9117)\r\n- Config.toml and rules parsing errors are reported to app-server clients/TUI instead of failing silently.

(#9213)\r\n- Collaboration tools gained richer agent control: `spawn_agent` accepts an agent role preset, and `send_input` can optionally interrupt a running agent before delivering the message. (#9275, #9276)\r\n- `/models` metadata now includes upgrade migration markdown so clients can display richer guidance when suggesting model upgrades. (#9219)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- [revert] Linux sandboxing now falls back to Landlock-only restrictions when user namespaces are unavailable, and sets `no_new_privs` before applying sandbox rules. (#9250)\r\n- `codex resume --last` now respects the current working directory, with `--all` as an explicit override.

			"body": "## New Features\n- API v2 threads can now inject dynamic tools at startup and route their calls/responses end-to-end through the server and core tool pipeline. (#9539)\n- Added filtering on the thread list in the app server to make large thread sets easier to browse. (#9897)\n- Introduced a `thread/unarchive` RPC to restore archived rollouts back into active sessions. (#9843)\n- MCP servers can now define OAuth scopes in `config.toml`, reducing the need to pass `--scopes` on each login. (#9647)\n- Multi-agent collaboration is more capable and safer, with an explorer role, better collab event mapping, and max-depth guardrails. (#9817, #9818, #9918, #9899)\n- Cached `web_search` is now the default client behavior. (#9974)\n\n## Bug Fixes\n- Fixed a TUI deadlock/freeze under high streaming throughput by avoiding blocking sends on the main Tokio thread. (#9951)\n- The `web_search` tool now handles and displays all action types, and shows in-progress activity instead of appearing stuck. (#9960)\n- Reduced high CPU usage in collaboration flows by eliminating busy-waiting on subagents. (#9776)\n- Fixed `codex resume --last --json` so prompts parse correctly without conflicting argument errors. (#9475)\n- Windows sandbox logging now handles UTF-8 safely, preventing failures when truncating multibyte content. (#8647)\n- `request_user_input` is now rejected outside Plan/Pair modes to prevent invalid tool calls. (#9955)\n\n## Documentation\n- Updated the contribution guidelines for clearer onboarding and workflow expectations. (#9933)\n- Refreshed protocol/MCP docs to reflect `thread/unarchive` and the updated `request_user_input` question shape. (#9843, #9890)\n\n## Chores\n- Self-update via Homebrew now uses an explicit cask upgrade command to avoid warnings and ambiguity. (#9823)\n- Release packaging now consistently writes the bundle zip to `dist/`. (#9934)\n- Updated key dependencies in the Rust workspace (including `axum`, `tracing`, `globset`, and `tokio-test`). (#9880, #9882, #9883, #9884)\n- Aligned feature stage naming with public maturity stages and added clearer warnings for underdevelopment features.

			"body": "## New Features\n- Added `codex app <path>` on macOS to launch Codex Desktop from the CLI, with automatic DMG download if it is missing. (#10418)\n- Added personal skill loading from `~/.agents/skills` (with `~/.codex/skills` compatibility), plus app-server APIs/events to list and download public remote skills. (#10437, #10448)\n- `/plan` now accepts inline prompt arguments and pasted images, and slash-command editing/highlighting in the TUI is more polished. (#10269)\n- Shell-related tools can now run in parallel, improving multi-command execution throughput. (#10505)\n- Shell executions now receive `CODEX_THREAD_ID`, so scripts and skills can detect the active thread/session. (#10096)\n- Added vendored Bubblewrap + FFI wiring in the Linux sandbox as groundwork for upcoming runtime integration. (#10413)\n\n## Bug Fixes\n- Hardened Git command safety so destructive or write-capable invocations no longer bypass approval checks. (#10258)\n- Improved resume/thread browsing reliability by correctly showing saved thread names and fixing thread listing behavior. (#10340, #10383)\n- Fixed first-run trust-mode handling so sandbox mode is reported consistently, and made `$PWD/.agents` read-only like `$PWD/.codex`. (#10415, #10524)\n- Fixed `codex exec` hanging after interrupt in websocket/streaming flows; interrupted turns now shut down cleanly. (#10519)\n- Fixed review-mode approval event wiring so `requestApproval` IDs align with the corresponding command execution items. (#10416)\n- Improved 401 error diagnostics by including server message/body details plus `cf-ray` and `requestId`. (#10508)\n\n## Documentation\n- Expanded TUI chat composer docs to cover slash-command arguments and attachment handling in plan/review flows. (#10269)\n- Refreshed issue templates and labeler prompts to better separate CLI/app bug reporting and feature requests. (#10411, #10453, #10548, #10552)\n\n## Chores\n- Completed migration off the deprecated `mcp-types` crate to `rmcp`-based protocol types/adapters, then removed the legacy crate. (#10356, #10349, #10357)\n- Updated the `bytes` dependency for a security advisory and cleaned up resolved advisory configuration.

(#10445)\n- Added websocket-side rate limit signaling via a new `codex.rate_limits` event, with websocket parity for ETag/reasoning metadata handling. (#10324)\n- Enabled `unified_exec` on all non-Windows platforms. (#10641)\n- Constrained requirement values now include source provenance, enabling source-aware config debugging in UI flows like `/debug-config`. (#10568)\n\n## Bug Fixes\n- Fixed `Esc` handling in the TUI `request_user_input` overlay: when notes are open, `Esc` now exits notes mode instead of interrupting the session. (#10569)\n- Thread listing now queries the state DB first (including archived threads) and falls back to filesystem traversal only when needed, improving listing correctness and resilience. (#10544)\n- Fixed thread path lookup to require that the resolved file actually exists, preventing invalid thread-id resolutions. (#10618)\n- Dynamic tool injection now runs in a single transaction to avoid partial state updates. (#10614)\n- Refined `request_rule` guidance used in approval-policy prompting to correct rule behavior. (#10379, #10598)\n\n## Documentation\n- Updated app-server docs for `thread/compact` to clarify its asynchronous behavior and thread-busy lifecycle. (#10445)\n- Updated TUI docs to match the mode-specific `Esc` behavior in `request_user_input`. (#10569)\n\n## Chores\n- Migrated state DB helpers to a versioned SQLite filename scheme and cleaned up legacy state files during runtime initialization.

			"body": "## New Features\n- Added an experimental, feature-gated JavaScript REPL runtime (`js_repl`) that can persist state across tool calls, with optional runtime path overrides. (#10674)\n- Added support for multiple simultaneous rate limits across the protocol, backend client, and TUI status surfaces. (#11260)\n- Reintroduced app-server websocket transport with a split inbound/outbound architecture, plus connection-aware thread resume subscriptions. (#11370, #11474)\n- Added memory management slash commands in the TUI (`/m_update`, `/m_drop`) and expanded memory-read/metrics plumbing. (#11569, #11459, #11593)\n- Enabled Apps SDK apps in ChatGPT connector handling. (#11486)\n- Promoted sandbox capabilities on both Linux and Windows, and introduced a new `ReadOnlyAccess` policy shape for configurable read access. (#11381, #11341, #11387)\n\n## Bug Fixes\n- Fixed websocket incremental output duplication, prevented appends after `response.completed`, and treated `response.incomplete` as an error path. (#11383, #11402, #11558)\n- Improved websocket session stability by continuing ping handling when idle and suppressing noisy first-retry errors during quick reconnects. (#11413, #11548)\n- Fixed stale thread entries by dropping missing rollout files and cleaning stale DB metadata during thread listing. (#11572)\n- Fixed Windows multi-line paste reliability in terminals (especially VS Code integrated terminal) by increasing paste burst timing tolerance. (#9348)\n- Fixed incorrect inheritance of `limit_name` when merging partial rate-limit updates. (#11557)\n- Reduced repeated skill parse-error spam during active edits by increasing file-watcher debounce from 1s to 10s. (#11494)\n\n## Documentation\n- Added JS REPL documentation and config/schema guidance for enabling and configuring the feature. (#10674)\n- Updated app-server websocket transport documentation in the app-server README. (#11370)\n\n## Chores\n- Split `codex-common` into focused `codex-utils-*` crates to simplify dependency boundaries across Rust workspace components. (#11422)\n- Improved Rust release pipeline throughput and reliability for Windows and musl targets, including parallel Windows builds and musl link fixes. (#11488, #11500, #11556)\n- Prevented GitHub release asset upload collisions by excluding duplicate `cargo-timing.html` artifacts.

			"body": "## New Features\n- Added a more unified permissions flow, including clearer permissions history in the TUI and a slash command to grant sandbox read access when directories are blocked. (#11633, #11512, #11550, #11639)\n- Introduced structured network approval handling, with richer host/protocol context shown directly in approval prompts. (#11672, #11674)\n- Expanded app-server fuzzy file search with explicit session-complete signaling so clients can stop loading indicators reliably. (#10268, #11773)\n- Added customizable multi-agent roles via config, including migration toward the new multi-agent naming/config surface. (#11917, #11982, #11939, #11918)\n- Added a `model/rerouted` notification so clients can detect and render model reroute events explicitly. (#12001)\n\n## Bug Fixes\n- Fixed remote image attachments so they persist correctly across resume/backtrack and history replay in the TUI. (#10590)\n- Fixed a TUI accessibility regression where animation gating for screen reader users was not consistently respected. (#11860)\n- Fixed app-server thread resume behavior to correctly rejoin active in-memory threads and tighten invalid resume cases. (#11756)\n- Fixed `model/list` output to return full model data plus visibility metadata, avoiding unintended server-side filtering. (#11793)\n- Fixed several `js_repl` stability issues, including reset hangs, in-flight tool-call races, and a `view_image` panic path. (#11932, #11922, #11800, #11796)\n- Fixed app integration edge cases in mention parsing and app list loading/filtering behavior. (#11894, #11518, #11697)\n\n## Documentation\n- Updated contributor guidance to require snapshot coverage for user-visible TUI changes. (#10669)\n- Updated docs/help text around Codex app and MCP command usage. (#11926, #11813)\n\n## Chores\n- Improved developer log tooling with new `just log --search` and `just log --compact` modes. (#11995, #11994)\n- Updated vendored `rg` and tightened Bazel/Cargo lockfile sync checks to reduce dependency drift.
